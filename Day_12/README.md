# Day 12 : String Slicing & Operations on String

## Length of a String
We can find the length of a string using len() function.

**Example:**
```
fruit = "Mango"
len1 = len(fruit)
print("Mango is a", len1, "letter word.")
```

Output:
```
Mango is a 5 letter word.
```

## String as an array
A string is essentially a sequence of characters also called an array. Thus we can access the elements of this array.

**Example:**
```
pie = "ApplePie"
print(pie[:5])
print(pie[6])	#returns character at specified index
```

Output:
```
Apple
i
```

**Note:** This method of specifying the start and end index to specify a part of a string is called slicing.

**Slicing Example:**
```
pie = "ApplePie"
print(pie[:5])      #Slicing from Start
print(pie[5:])      #Slicing till End
print(pie[2:6])     #Slicing in between
print(pie[-8:])     #Slicing using negative index
```

Output:
```
Apple
Pie
pleP
ApplePie
```

## Loop through a String:
Strings are arrays and arrays are iterable. Thus we can loop through strings.

**Example:**
```
alphabets = "ABCDE"
for i in alphabets:
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
A
B
C
D
E
```
