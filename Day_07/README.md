# Day 7 : Exercise 1 - Create a Calculator

## Operators

Python has different types of operators for different operations. To create a calculator we require arithmetic operators.

## Arithmetic operators

|  Operator  |  Name	 |  Example  |
|:----------:|:-------:|:---------:|
|  +  |	 Addition	 |  15+7  |
|  -  |  Subtraction  |	 15-7  |
|  *  |  Multiplication  |  5*7  |
|  **  |	 Exponential	 |  5**3  |
|  /  |	 Division  |	 5/3  |
|  %	 |  Modulus  |	 15%7  |
|  //  |	 Floor Division  |	 15//7  |

## Exercise

```
n = 15
m = 7

ans1 = n+m
print("Addition of",n,"and",m,"is", ans1)

ans2 = n-m
print("Subtraction of",n,"and",m,"is", ans2)

ans3 = n*m
print("Multiplication of",n,"and",m,"is", ans3)

ans4 = n/m
print("Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans4)

ans5 = n%m
print("Modulus of",n,"and",m,"is", ans5)

ans6 = n//m
print("Floor Division of",n,"and",m,"is", ans6)
```

**Explaination**

Here `n` and `m` are two variables in which the integer value is being stored. Variables `ans1`, `ans2`, `ans3`, `ans4`, `ans5` and `ans6` contains the outputs corresponding to addition, subtraction,multiplication, division, modulus and floor division respectively.

## Exercise 1 - Create a Calculator

Create a calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations on two numbers. Your program should format the output in a readable manner!
